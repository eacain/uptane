uptane_test_instructions.py

This is demonstration code for Uptane.

The code below is intended to be run IN FIVE OR MORE PYTHON SHELLS:
- One for the OEM Repository, speaking HTTP
- One for the Director (Repository and Service), speaking HTTP and XMLRPC
- One for the Timeserver, speaking XMLRPC (receives requests for signed times)
- One for the Primary client in the vehicle, speaking XMLRPC and consuming HTTP
- One (or more) for Secondary clients in the vehicle, speaking XMLRPC

Each shell should be run in a python environment (the same environment is
fine) that has the awwad/tuf:pinning version of TUF installed. In order to
get everything you need, run the following:
`pip install cffi==1.7.0 pycrypto==2.6.1 pynacl==1.0.1 cryptography`
`pip install git+git://github.com/awwad/tuf.git@pinning`

# (If you run into issues installing cryptography, you may need to:
#   apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
# )
# More instructions for other distributions at
# https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/README.rst


If you're going to be running the ASN.1 encoding scripts (not involved here),
you'll also need to `pip install pyasn1`
