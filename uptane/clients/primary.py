  """
  Fields:

    vin:
      Vehicle identification, whether "VIN" or some other unique identifier.
      Compliant with uptane.formats.VIN_SCHEMA

    ecu_serial:
      The identification string for this Primary ECU.
      Compliant with uptane.formats.ECU_SERIAL_SCHEMA

    primary_key:
      The signing key that the Primary ECU will use to sign the Vehicle Version
      Manifest before sending it to the Primary.

    ecu_manifests:
      A dictionary containing the manifests provided by all ECUs. Will include
      all manifests sent by all ECUs. The Primary does not verify signatures on
      ECU manifests according to the Implementation Specification.
      Compromised ECUs may send bogus ECU manifests, so we simply send all
      manifests to the Director, who will sort through and discern what is
      going on.

    updater:
      A tuf.client.updater.Updater object used to retrieve metadata and
      target files from the Director and Supplier repositories.

    full_client_dir:
      The absolute directory where all client data is stored for the Primary.
      e.g. /Users/s/w/uptane/temp_primaryclient

    timeserver_public_key:
      The public key matching the private key that we expect the timeserver to
      use when signing attestations. Validation is against this key.

    my_secondaries:
      This is a list of all ECU Serials belonging to Secondaries of this
      Primary.

      # # TODO: <~> This next field makes assumptions that are not in the Uptane
      # #           specification, to handle some Sam code. Remove the assumption
      # #           at some point. (The Primary config enum is outside the spec.)
      # This is a dictionary with an entry for every Secondary that this Primary
      # communicates with.
      # The dictionary maps ecu_serial to that ECU's number in the enumeration
      # in the Primary's config file, for communication purposes.
      # e.g. {
      #     'ecuserial1234': 0,
      #     'ecuserial5678': 1}

    nonces_to_send:
      The list of nonces sent to us from Secondaries and not yet sent to the
      Timeserver.

    nonces_sent:
      The list of nonces sent to the Timeserver by our Secondaries, which we
      have already sent to the Timeserver. Will be checked against the
      Timeserver's response.

    all_valid_timeserver_attestations:
      A list of all attestations received from Timeservers that have been
      validated by validate_time_attestation.
      Items are appended to the end.

    all_valid_timeserver_times:
      A list of all times extracted from all Timeserver attestations that have
      been validated by validate_time_attestation.
      Items are appended to the end.

  Use:
    import uptane.clients.primary as primary
